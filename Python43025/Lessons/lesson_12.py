## lets build a simple calculator
## we will use the eval() function to evaluate the expression
## we will use the input() function to get the expression from the user
## we will use the while loop to keep the program running until the user enters "quit"
## we will use the if statement to check if the user entered "quit"

expression = ""
while expression.lower() != "quit":
    expression = input("Please enter your expression: ")
